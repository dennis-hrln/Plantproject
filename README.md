This is a project where I use an arduino to get Sensor data for the soil moisture of a plant and water it accordingly.
The Sensor Data is logged in a CSV file on a SD card connected to the arduino.

This project uses an Arduino Uno, LCD Display, RTC module, SD - card module, PLant moisture sensor and other small elements like trans/ resistor,...

The CAD Files for the case will be uploaded in the future,
